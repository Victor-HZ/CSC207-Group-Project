This application will provide the user with a suggested plan for their date. 
The user should be able to input a calendar date and specifications such as time (having lunch together) or preferences (crafty activities vs. athletic ones vs. educational ones etc.).
The application will provide weather considerations, restaurant and activity suggestions, as well as maps/transit and estimated costs.
