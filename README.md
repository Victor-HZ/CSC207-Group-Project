# CSC207-Group-Project
A lovely dating planner. <br>
This application will provide the user with a suggested plan for their date. <br>
The user should be able to input a calendar date and specifications such as time (having lunch together) or preferences (crafty activities vs. athletic ones vs. educational ones etc.). <br>
This application will provide the following features: weather considerations, restaurant and activity suggestions, as well as maps/transit and estimated costs.
